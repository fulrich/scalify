## {{page.title}}
Scalify Plus is a concept taken from ScalaTest and Play! Framework.
We wanted Scalify to be independent from specific frameworks so we didn't force developers away from frameworks they preferred.
However we still wanted a way to provide developers with a ready to go example with convenient helpers.

From this spawned the idea of "Scalify Plus". 
Scalify Plus is a set of libraries that contains convenience helpers for specific Scala frameworks.
It is a way for us to provide the best of both worlds. 
A fully independent library and a set of libraries that are more guided.

Scalify Plus libraries wrap the Scalify core library and hook it into the specific framework that plus library is designed to augment.
If you are using one of the libraries provided by Scalify Plus we recommend you include those libraries with your projectl; however you can still grab just the core Scalify and use just that with your application.
